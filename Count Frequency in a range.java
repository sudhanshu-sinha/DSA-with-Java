Problem statement
You are given an array 'arr' of length 'n' containing integers within the range '1' to 'x'.



Your task is to count the frequency of all elements from 1 to n.

Note:
You do not need to print anything. Return a frequency array as an array in the function such that index 0 represents the frequency of 1, index 1 represents the frequency of 2, and so on.
Example:
Input: ‘n’ = 6 ‘x’ = 9 ‘arr’ = [1, 3, 1, 9, 2, 7]    
Output: [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: Below Table shows the number and their counts, respectively, in the array
Number         Count 
 1                2
 2                1
 3                1
 4                0
 5                0
 6                0
